# Configuration management

## What to do

In order to securely access certain resources of our organization we need to setup a VPN server (OCServ or any other VPN server). This must be achieved by using a configuration manager, we use Ansible at Flywire but feel free to use the CM that you prefer.

## Definition of Done

* Have a coded configuration for a VPN service with all necessary steps: Certificate generation, service configuration, etc.

## Considerations

* Ask if you need some clarification ‚ùì
* Don't panic üòü if the code is not fully working, we're looking for patterns and check that you understand the scenario and what is a CM and start working on it.
